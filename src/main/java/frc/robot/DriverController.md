# Driver's Xbox Controller Button Assignments
Driver's controller must be in position zero in Driver Station's USB tab.

- **Left joystick**, in both fore-and-aft and side-to-side directions, controls translation (movements with rotation) of robot.  These are field oriented unless the left bumper is also pressed.  E.g., pushing left joystick forward causes robot to move downfield.
- **Right joystick**: side-to-side manipulation causes robot to rotate
- **Y button** depressing this causes gyro to consider the current orientation of the robot to be downfield
- **Left bumper** while pressed, this causes translations to be relative to the robots front instead of relative to the field.

The other buttons do nothing.
