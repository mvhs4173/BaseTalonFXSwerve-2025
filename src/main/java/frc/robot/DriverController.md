# Driver's Xbox Controller Button Assignments
Driver's controller must be in position zero in Driver Station's USB tab.

- **Left joystick**, in both fore-and-aft and side-to-side directions, controls translation (movements with rotation) of robot.  These are field oriented unless the left bumper is also pressed.  E.g., pushing left joystick forward causes robot to move downfield.
- **Right joystick**: side-to-side manipulation causes robot to rotate
- **Y button** depressing this causes gyro to consider the current orientation of the robot to be downfield
- **Right bumper** - Extend Algae manipulator - extends the algae manipulator arm
- **Left Bumper** - Retract Algae manipulator - retracts the algae manipulator arm
- **X Button** - Roll inwards - rolls the roller inwards, use to intake an algae. Will stop intaking once algae is in and the current draw spikes
- **B Button** - Roll outwards - rolls the roller outwards, use to score algae or to remove algae from robot

The other buttons do nothing.
